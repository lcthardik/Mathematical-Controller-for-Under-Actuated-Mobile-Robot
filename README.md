# Mathematical-Controller-for-Under-Actuated-Mobile-Robot

### Abstract: The implementation and testing of real-time control of a two-wheeled mobile robot are described in this study. The mobile robot used in this study is underactuated with three inputs for mobility and two input for control. The challenge is to control the oscillation of the intermediate body while following the path. The robot is tested in three motions: translational, rotational, and uphill. A linear-quadratic regulator is designed and tested with the help of the simulation and required parameters are compared to get the best result.
